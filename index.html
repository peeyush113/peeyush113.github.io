            Linked lists, doubly linked lists, lock-free linked lists.
            B+ Trees with comments telling you what you can't find in the textbooks.
            Priority sorted lists used for mutexes, drivers, etc.
            Red-Black trees are used are used for scheduling, virtual memory management, to track file descriptors and directory entries, etc.
            Interval trees.
            Radix trees, are used for memory management, NFS related lookups and networking related functionality.
            Priority heap, which is literally, a textbook implementation, used in the control group system.
            Hash functions, with a reference to Knuth and to a paper.
            Some parts of the code, such as this driver, implement their own hash function.
            Hash tables used to implement inodes, file system integrity checks, etc.
            Bit arrays, which are used for dealing with flags, interrupts, etc. and are featured in Knuth Vol. 4.
            Semaphores and spin locks.
            Binary search is used for interrupt handling, register cache lookup, etc.
            Binary search with B-trees.
            Depth first search and variant used in directory configuration.
            Breadth first search is used to check correctness of locking at runtime.
            Merge sort on linked lists is used for garbage collection, file system management, etc.
            Bubble sort is amazingly implemented too, in a driver library.
            Knuth-Morris-Pratt string matching.
            Boyer-Moore pattern matching with references and recommendations for when to prefer the alternative.

          We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through
          them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can
          revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it
          remained markdown format.

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
